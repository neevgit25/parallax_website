      <h2>All about India</h2>
      <p>
        India is the largest democratic country in the world. On the basis of
        population, India is the largest county after China. India has 28 states
        and 9 Union Territories. Jammu & Kashmir and Leh Ladakh are the newly
        formed Union Territories which were formally one state (Jammu &
        Kashmir). India is the birthplace of religions like Hinduism, Buddhism,
        Jainism, Sikhism, etc. However, people of almost every religion live
        here with great fraternity and brotherhood. There are many languages,
        tribes, cultures in India. I love India and Iâ€™m proud to be an Indian.
